    <h3>About University</h3>
    <p>
        The University came into existence in the beginning of 60's as a teaching-cum-affiliating university. Since its inception, the University has been alive to the ever-increasing demands of higher education. Keeping pace with changing times, the University today offers many vocational courses. For the less privileged students coming from the scheduled tribes or backward class, special coaching classes are organized from time to time to prepare them for competitive examinations.
