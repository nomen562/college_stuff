    <h1>IONS</h1>
    <p>
        For ions, the charge on a particular atom may be denoted with a superscript. For example Na<sup>+</sup>, 
        or Cu<sup>2+</sup>. The total charge on a charged molecule or a polyatomic ion may also be shown in this way. 
        For example: H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> or SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more complex ions, brackets [ ] are often used to enclose the ionic formula, as in 
        [B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, which is found in compounds such as Cs<sub>2</sub>[B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]. 
        Parentheses ( ) can be nested inside brackets to indicate a repeating unit, as in 
        [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>. Here (NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> indicates that the ion contains six 
        NH<sub>3</sub> groups, and [ ] encloses the entire formula of the ion with charge <sup>+3</sup>.
